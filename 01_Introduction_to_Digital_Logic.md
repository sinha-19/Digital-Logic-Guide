# 01. Introduction to Digital Logic

## What is Digital Logic?

**Digital logic** is the foundation of modern electronics and computing, dealing with circuits that use discrete (binary) signals to process, store, and transmit information. Every computer, microcontroller, and digital system relies on digital logic design.

---

## Analog vs. Digital

- **Analog:** Continuous signals (all voltages possible).
- **Digital:** Discrete signals (usually only two: 0 and 1).

---

## Binary System

- Digital logic uses the **binary system**: two states (0 and 1), often represented by low (0V) and high (5V, 3.3V, etc.) voltages.

---

## Advantages of Digital Systems

- **Noise Immunity:** Less affected by electrical noise.
- **Ease of Design:** Simpler to design, replicate, and troubleshoot.
- **Reliability:** Digital circuits are more robust and predictable.
- **Data Storage & Processing:** Easier to store, process, and transmit data.

## Digital Logic in Everyday Life

- Computers and smartphones
- Digital watches and clocks
- Calculators
- Digital cameras
- Home appliances (microwave, washing machine)
- Automobiles (engine control, dashboard)

## Digital Logic System Overview

- **Input Devices:** Switches, sensors, keypads.
- **Processing Devices:** Logic gates, circuits, processors.
- **Output Devices:** LEDs, displays, motors.

---

## Basic Elements

- **Logic Gates:** AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR.
- **Combinational Circuits:** Output depends only on present inputs (e.g., adders, multiplexers).
- **Sequential Circuits:** Output depends on present inputs and previous states (e.g., flip-flops, counters).

## Digital Design Flow

1. **Specification:** Define function and requirements.
2. **Truth Table:** List all possible input/output combinations.
3. **Boolean Expression:** Write logic equations.
4. **Circuit Design:** Draw gate-level schematic.
5. **Minimization:** Simplify logic expressions (K-maps, Boolean algebra).
6. **Implementation:** Build with gates/fabricate on chip.
7. **Testing & Verification:** Check function and timing.

---

## Logic Families

- **TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic)**
- **CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor)**
- **ECL (Emitter-Coupled Logic)**

---

## Historical Perspective

- Based on Boolean algebra (George Boole, 1854).
- First digital computers: ENIAC, UNIVAC.
- Modern systems: billions of gates in microprocessors.

## Applications

- Computing: CPUs, memory, GPUs
- Communications: Routers, switches
- Consumer electronics: TVs, gaming consoles
- Control systems: Robotics, automation
