---

## Interview Patterns

1. **Number Systems**
    - Convert between binary, decimal, octal, hexadecimal.
    - Represent negative numbers in 2’s complement.
    - Use Gray code for error minimization.

2. **Boolean Algebra & Minimization**
    - Simplify expressions using Boolean laws and K-maps.
    - Identify and use prime implicants and don’t-cares.

3. **Combinational Circuits**
    - Design multiplexers, adders, encoders, decoders.
    - Implement logic with only NAND/NOR gates.
    - Realize functions with MUX/decoders.

4. **Sequential Circuits**
    - Write characteristic and excitation tables for flip-flops.
    - Convert between flip-flop types.
    - Design counters and shift registers.

5. **FSMs and PLDs**
    - Draw state diagrams/tables for FSMs.
    - Reduce states, implement FSMs with flip-flops.
    - Compare and design with PLA, PAL, FPGA.

6. **Timing and Hazards**
    - Identify hazards and propose solutions.
    - Calculate maximum clock frequency.
    - Explain metastability and clock skew.
